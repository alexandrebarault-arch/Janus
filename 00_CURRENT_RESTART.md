# JANUS — ACTIVE RESTART / 20 October 2026 — Step35

BRANCH: research/gate2b-nonhomothetic-transfer. Leave main and research/v2-flrw untouched.

**FIRST READ:** research/RESTRICTED_REGULAR_CENTER_SECONDARY_STEP35_AUDIT.md
**SOURCE:** numerics/hr_regular_secondary_flat.py
**TEST:** tests/test_hr_regular_secondary_flat.py
**REPORT:** research/reports/gate2b-step35-report.json
**REPRO:** OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_hr_regular_secondary_flat.py

## Latest actually executed

11/11 targeted tests passed in isolated reconstructed /mnt/data/janus-step35 (Python with numpy and pytest), using source/test with Git blob SHAs d30281a11d854084270a4f536e24e2dc857d58fc and 6425b1c36c8d7e4401bfffe6dabf4f9b31f58cc6. Whole repository and other prior Step33/34 tests were NOT rerun. GitHub workflows disabled; full clone DNS unavailable.

## Scientific increment

On previously derived Step33f exact flat/comoving, nondegenerate-J local mixed Poisson bracket, C_flat = (m² Mg² a² J/2)*(r³ X)' with X=Pg/(Mg²a)-Pf/(Mf²b). Hence local C=0 implies r³ X=constant; CENTER REGULARITY forces X=0 everywhere. This NECESSITY (not just sufficiency) holds only in this restricted family.

An explicit radially varying positive TWO-dust primary+restricted-secondary witness at a=.4 has pg/r²>=.9, pf/r²>=.124128 on [0,1] for eps=.08; 5 eps cases including -.15 remain positive. Deliberately perturbing Pf separately retains the primaries but violates the secondary. Thirty dust-only Candidate-C points have J>.52; J=0 is an EXCLUDED degenerate relative-shift chart, not proven safe.

## WARNING: orphaned Step34 checkpoint

research/STEP34_CHECKPOINT.txt exists but referenced Step34 audit, test, runner and JSON do not appear in branch tree; only its source numerics/hr_original_discrete_pb.py exists. No new claim that historical Step34 tests can be rerun from this repository.

## HARD NEXT RED

Construct curved/noncomoving primary+LOCAL SECONDARY=0 on continuous radial interval using C_local=K00-(K01)' (not mere integral); preserve positivity of both dust densities, relative-shift K/J nondegeneracy, center regularity. THEN compute Dirac time preservation, full bracket rank and lapse fixing; THEN same-action nonhomothetic on-shell + De Felice/Aoki physical oracles before first fold. Distinct external JHR wrong-EH-sign audit stays separate.

VERDICT: STEP35 restricted rigidity tested; GATE_2B=OPEN; JANUS-R NOT VALIDATED. No physical ghost/gradient/fold/CMB viability conclusion.
